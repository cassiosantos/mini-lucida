# mini-lucida
This is a minimal repository containing everything to setup Lucida via Kubernetes on an Ubuntu host.

Just run
```
sh ubuntu_all_in_one.sh
```

to setup Lucida on a fresh Ubuntu instance.

Tested on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.5, 16.04.1 and 16.04.2 as well as Ubuntu Server 14.04.5 Server, all 64bit.

Please note that the final step can take 15 minutes, so do not get discouraged if it takes a while until all services are running.
